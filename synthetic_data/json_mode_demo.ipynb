During his observation jump, a minor power fluctuation in his Chrono-suit causes a momentary disorientation, and he inadvertently displaces a small, crucial statue from a niche on a building. \\\\n\\\\nReturning to his present, Elias notices subtle, then increasingly alarming, discrepancies. The artistic movement he was studying never flourished, leading to a domino effect of historical divergence. The present world is darker, dominated by a pervasive, joyless totalitarian regime that stifled creativity centuries ago â€“ a direct result of the statue\\'s absence preventing a crucial conversation between the two historical figures. Elias realizes his seemingly insignificant act created a catastrophic paradox. \\\\n\\\\nHe must return to 16th-century Venice, not just to observe, but to intervene and replace the statue. However, the TIB\\'s strict non-interference protocols mean his desperate plan is highly illegal and would trigger their \\'Temporal Correction\\' units.
